Creative Tilt: <br />
    Made a 'lofi beat' for the first time. Autotuned 3 different turkey sounds and <br />
    programmatically chose which one to use based on what portion of the song is playing<br />
    (check the playCall method in turkey.js). Drew a squirrel for the first time.<br />
    Tested and iterated on feel and gameplay, adjusting float and fall rate and jump height.
